# PervasiveComputing-Neville
Created a C++ program to configure an mbed arm system similar to an Arduino board. Programmed a robot named Neville to follow a black path on a white board and stop at T-junctions. Speeds were also varied depending on the colors that were sensed by the sensor in its environment.
